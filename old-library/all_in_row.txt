Sofia stepped over a pile of books on the Library floor and picked up a strange note on the librarian's desk.
“Hey Stephen,” she whispered.
“Yes?” he whispered back.
“What do you think this note is about?
“Well how should I...? Why are we whispering?” He asked getting louder.
“SHUSH! We are in a Library. Be quiet!” She shot the response back at him. “There’s a bunch of lists on here...”
“So sort them.”
“Now why would I do that?”
“Maybe because it’s a secret code or something.”
“That would be AWESOME!” Sofia almost shouted.
“Shhhh! We’re in a library!” Stephen scolded.
There is a list that contains integers, list of integers or nested lists. Put all integer values into one list.

Input data: A nested list or simple list.

Output data: A one-dimensional list.

Example:

checkio([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
checkio([1, [2, 2, 2], 4]) == [1, 2, 2, 2, 4]
checkio([[[2]], [4, [5, 6, [6], 6, 6, 6], 7]]) == [2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]
