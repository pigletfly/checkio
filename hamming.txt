The Hamming distance between two binary integers is the number of bit positions that differs 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance). For example:

    117 = 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
     17 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
      H = 0+1+1+0+0+1+0+0 = 3

Given two positive integers in decimal form. You should calculate the Hamming distance between these two numbers 
in binary form.

Input: A list of two integers.

Output: An integer.

Example:

checkio([117, 17]) == 3
checkio([1, 2]) == 2
checkio([16, 15]) == 5
