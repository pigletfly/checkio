Sofia found Stephen working in the garden.
“Stephen!” she shouted.
“No.” he replied gloomily.
“What was that?”
“I said NO! I won’t do it!” Stephen repeated again as he stood up.

Teach Sofia how to use an ATM. The ATM on their home island can only dispense $5 bills which means that the machine will not dispense any amount of money that is not divisible by $5. In addition to that, the bank fee for each withdrawal is $1. The robots cannot withdraw any amount above the card’s balance.

Input: A list of integers: the first one denotes the robot’s account balance, and the second is a list of the monetary amounts that the robot wants to withdraw.

Output: The account balance after all operations (integer).

Example:
Withdraw without error
120 - 10 - 1 = 109
109 - 20 - 1 = 88
88 - 30 - 1 = 57

checkio([120, [10, 20, 30]]) == 57
checkio([120, [200, 10]]) == 109
checkio([120,[3, 10]]) == 109
checkio([120, [200 , 119]]) == 120
checkio([120, [120, 10, 122, 2, 10, 10, 30, 1]]) == 56
