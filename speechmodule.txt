"Stephen, how much do we still have to load?" Called out Nikola from the cargo hold.

Stephen's speech module is broken. This module is responsible for his number pronunciation. He has to click to input all of the numerical digits in a figure, so when there are big numbers it can take him a long time. Help the robot to speak properly and faster by writing his speech module. All the words in the string must be separated by exactly one space character.

Input: Integer number from 0 to 999.

Output: A string representation of this number.

Example:

checkio(4)=='four'
checkio(143)=='one hundred forty three'
checkio(12)=='twelve'
checkio(101)=='one hundred one'
checkio(212)=='two hundred twelve'
checkio(40)=='forty'
