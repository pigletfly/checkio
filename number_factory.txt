Given an positive ( > 0 ) integer N. You should find the smallest positive ( > 0 ) number of X, such that the product of its digits is equal to the number of N. If number X does not exist, then return 0. For one-digit numbers, the answer is a number itself.

Hints: Remember about prime numbers (or numbers divided at non one digit prime number) and be careful with eternal loops.

Input: An Integer.

Output: An Integer.

Example:
checkio(20) == 45
checkio(21) == 37
checkio(17) == 0
checkio(33) == 0
checkio(5) == 5
