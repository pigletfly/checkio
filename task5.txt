A median is a number in a list that is in between the highest numbers and the lowest numbers. If there is an even number of numbers, then there is no single middle value: the median is then defined as the mean or average of the two middle values. For this mission, you are given a list of integers. With it, you must separate the upper half of the numbers, from the lower half and find the median.

If you would like more information, you can read about the subject on Wikipedia.

Input: A list of integers.

Output: A float.

Example:

checkio([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 3
checkio([3, 1, 2, 5, 3]) == 3
checkio([1, 300, 2, 200, 1]) == 2
checkio([3, 6, 20, 99, 10, 15]) == 12.5
